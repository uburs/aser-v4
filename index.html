    <H1>Study 2</H1>
    <div class="introduction">

        <P>The purpose of Study 2 is for you to interact with four different caption prototypes, answer few quiz based on the captions, and do the post-study surveys.</P>


        <p><b>Prototype 1: Basic Real-Time Captioning</b><br>
        The first page of the prototype demonstrates a straightforward implementation of real-time captioning. The captions
        are displayed in a dedicated caption box adjacent to the video feed of the speaker. This setup allows users to read the
        captions while still being able to observe the speaker’s facial expressions and body language. The text is animated to
        appear sequentially, simulating a live transcription environment.</p>

        <p><b>Prototype 2: Real-time Caption Overlay on Video Feed</b><br>
        This prototype introduces a real-time caption overlay on the video feed of the speaker. This ensures that users can read
        captions while simultaneously accessing the speaker’s facial expressions.</p>

        <p><b>Prototype 3: Enhanced Captioning with Emphasis</b><br>
        The third page focuses on integrating emotional expressions into the captions. Emotional words are identified and
        highlighted using color coding to reflect the speaker’s tone (e.g., green for happy, blue for sad). The captions are overlaid
        on the live video feed, and the text moves upward, similar to real-time scrolling captions seen in live broadcasts.</p>

        <p><b>Prototype 4: Real-time Caption with Emoji and Avatar</b><br>
        The fourth page explores a more interactive approach by introducing emoji that changes facial expressions and gestures
        based on the emotional tone of the text.</p>
